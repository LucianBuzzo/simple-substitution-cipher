# Frequency Analysis with Quadgrams

This is the source code used in [my article on frequency analysis](https://lucianbuzzo.com/exploring-cryptography-frequency-analysis-pt3/). It uses a quadgram frequency analysis to crack a simple substitution cipher.

If you'd like to run the code yourself, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LucianBuzzo/simple-substitution-cipher.git
npm i
```

Then you can run the code with:

```bash
npx jest
```
